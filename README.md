# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz
This project is a timed coding quiz that tests your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. The quiz application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It provides a clean, polished, and responsive user interface to help you gauge your progress compared to your peers.

<h2>User Story</h2>
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
When I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
When I answer a question, I am presented with another question.
When I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.
When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
Click the "Start Quiz" button to start the quiz.
Answer the multiple-choice questions as quickly and accurately as you can.
When the quiz is over, enter your initials and click the "Submit" button to save your score.
